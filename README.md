# nlp-NLP Fine-Tuning Platform using Hugging Face & Custom Datasets
This project is an interactive NLP model fine-tuning platform built using the Hugging Face ecosystem. It allows users to:
->Select any pre-trained model from Hugging Face's model hub
->Choose a dataset from Hugging Face or upload their own custom dataset
->Fine-tune models by adjusting key hyperparameters
->Evaluate and compare results to get the best performing model for specific NLP tasks like summarization
Key Features
->Custom Data Support: Upload your own dataset and preprocess it using the NLTK library (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, named entity recognition, Word2Vec embedding, etc.).
->Model Flexibility: Easily switch between different Hugging Face models for various NLP tasks.
->Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize performance by experimenting with different training parameters.
->Problem Solving Focus: Addresses the issue of generic summarization models (e.g., trained only on DailyMail) struggling with conversational texts. This platform enables fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets like Samsung conversation data to improve accuracy.
The main goal is to build a more adaptable and domain-specific NLP solution by empowering users to fine-tune models tailored to their specific needs, such as improving summarization performance on dialogues or informal communication.
